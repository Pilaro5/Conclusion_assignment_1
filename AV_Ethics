Although autonomous driving is still in its early stages, it is critical to consider the ethical issues surrounding this industry. 
Creating a moral code that allows a car to function ethically on the road, while behaving as closely as possible to human drivers, 
is a tough engineering challenge. This code will have to be adaptable to any scenario whether it is set by law, the owner, or the 
manufacturer. Overcoming this challenge will allow autonomous driving to improve road safety and our environmental footprint. 
(Here) Although driverless cars are projected to dramatically reduce the number of accidents and greatly improve road safety as well as 
traffic, they will first have to be equipped with the right software to reliably make better decisions in any situation.
